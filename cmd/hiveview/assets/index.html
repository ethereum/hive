            <h2>About Hive</h2>
            <p>Before Hive, we did have consensus-tests, in mainly two forms -- statetests
              and blockchain tests (yeah there are a few more). The tests were generated
              via aleth/testeth, and put on a repository. From that repo, it was expected
              that client teams import the tests and execute within their own custom
              test-harnesses.</p>
            <p>Now, that didn't work out perfectly. Client teams didn't always pull in the
              latest tests, and whether they actually executed the tests as intended was
              not sure. Did they correctly verify everything? It was especially
              troublesome when hardforks were approaching, and "oops, hey, we commented
              out test XX because it was failing".</p>
            <p>Then Péter Szilágyi (@karalabe) had this idea, to run clients totally black
              box. You spin up a node inside a docker container, start it with the
              client-specific config, and feed it the blocks. Another docker container
              'orchestrates' the test, and downloads the entire test repo from github
              (blockchain tests contain the RLP-blocks). So, after asking the client to
              import the blocks, all the 'orchestrator' needs to do is query "what's your
              latest block?", and verify it aginst the expected lastblock from the
              testcase.</p>
            <p>Those tests are what one normally talks about when talking about
              "hive-tests". However, Hive is even more versatile, since another
              "orchestrator" can do other things -- they can send any network message they
              want to the node-under-test. So far, we also have tests that verify that
              fast-sync can be performed, and tests to check that the p2p implementation
              does not make it possible to do DoS via amplification attacks. So those are
              also hive-tests. </p>
            <p>However, an important distinction: Hive is, in essence, a tool to
              <ul>
                <li>execute tests</li>
                <li>in an automated way,</li>
                <li>treating the clients as black boxes as far as possible.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>About the EF Hive executor</h2>
            <p>For the last ~3 years, we have had a hive-server running in production.
              https://hivetests.ethdevops.io/. It runs 24/7, and always fetches the latest
              tests from ethereum/tests repo.
