## Installing Hive

We have not tested hive on any OS other than Linux. It is usually best to use Ubuntu or
Debian.

First add `build-essential` by `sudo apt install build-essential`. Also install Go
version 1.17 or later and add it to your `$PATH` as described in the [Go installation
documentation]. You can check the installed Go version by running `go version`.

To get hive, you first need to clone the repository to the location of your choice.
Then you can build the hive executable.

    git clone https://github.com/ethereum/hive
    cd ./hive
    go build .

To run simulations, you need a working Docker setup. Hive needs to be run on the same
machine as dockerd. Using docker remotely is not supported at this time. [Install docker]
and add your user to the `docker` group to allow using docker without `sudo`.

    sudo usermod -a -G docker <user_name>

## Running Hive

All hive commands should be run from within the root of the repository. To run a
simulation, use the following command:

    ./hive --sim <simulation> --client <client(s) you want to test against>

For example, if you want to run the `discv4` test against geth, here is
how the command would look:

    ./hive --sim devp2p --sim.limit discv4 --client go-ethereum,nethermind

The client list may contain any number of clients. You can select a specific client
version by appending it to the client name with `_`, for example:

    ./hive --sim devp2p --client go-ethereum_v1.9.22,go-ethereum_v1.9.23

### Client Build Parameters

The client list for a run can also be given in a YAML file. This also allows further
customization of the build arguments of the client. Specify the `--client-file` option to
use a client list file.

    ./hive --sim my-simulation --client-file clients.yaml

Here is an example clients.yaml file:

    - client: go-ethereum
      dockerfile: git
    - client: nethermind
      build_args:
        baseimage: nethermindeth/hive
        tag: latest

For each client in the list, the following options can be given:

 - `client`: Name of the client. This must refer to a known client in the clients/ directory.
 - `dockerfile`: The Dockerfile extension to use. For example, specifying `git` here will
   build the client using `Dockerfile.git` instead of the default `Dockerfile`.
 - `nametag`: this can be used to assign a more descriptive name to the client. If unset,
   a unique nametag will be chosen based on the version tag and/or build arguments.
 - `build_args`: Build arguments passed to the Dockerfile, see below.

Supported build arguments depend on the client and the docker image being used. Common build
arguments are:

 - `tag`: The git commit/tag/branch or docker tag name to use.
 - `baseimage`: For clients pulled from DockerHub, this can be used to override the organization
   and image name. Example `ethereum/client-go`.
 - `github`: For client Dockerfiles building from git, this setting can be used to change
   the source code repository (fork) on GitHub. Example: `ethereum/go-ethereum`.

### Docker Options

`--docker.pull`: Setting this option makes hive re-pull the base images of all built
docker containers.

`--docker.output`: This enables printing of all docker container output to stderr.

`--docker.nocache <expression>`: Regular expression selecting docker images to forcibly
rebuild. You can use this option during simulator development to ensure a new image is
built even when there are no changes to the simulator code.

### Simulation Options

`--sim.limit <pattern>`: Specifies a regular expression to selectively enable suites and
test cases. This is interpreted by simulators. It sets the `HIVE_TEST_PATTERN` environment
variable.

The test pattern expression is usually interpreted as an unanchored match, i.e. an empty
pattern matches any suite/test name and the expression can match anywhere in name. To
improve command-line ergonomics, the test pattern is split at the first occurrence of `/`.
The part before `/` matches the suite name and everything after it matches test names.

For example, the following command runs the `devp2p` simulator, limiting the run to the
`eth` suite and selecting only tests containing the word `Large`.

    ./hive --sim devp2p --sim.limit eth/Large

This command runs the `consensus` simulator and runs only tests from the `stBugs`
directory (note the first `/`, matching any suite name):

    ./hive --sim ethereum/consensus --sim.limit /stBugs/

`--sim.timelimit <timeout>`: Simulation timeout. Hive aborts the simulator if it exceeds
this time. There is no default timeout.

`--client.checktimelimit <timeout>`: The timeout of waiting for clients to open up TCP
port 8545. If a very long chain is imported, this timeout may need to be quite long. A
lower value means that hive won't wait as long in case the node crashes and never opens
the RPC port. Defaults to 3 minutes.

`--sim.loglevel <level>`: Selects log level of client instances. Supports values 0-5,
defaults to 3. Note that this value may be overridden by simulators for specific clients.
This sets the default value of `HIVE_LOGLEVEL` in client containers.

`--sim.parallelism <number>`: Sets max number of parallel clients/containers. This is
interpreted by simulators. It sets the `HIVE_PARALLELISM` environment variable. Defaults
to 1.

## Viewing simulation results (hiveview)

The results of hive simulation runs are stored in JSON files containing test results, and
hive also creates several log files containing the output of the simulator and clients. To
view test results and logs in a web browser, you can use the `hiveview` tool. Build it
with:

    go build ./cmd/hiveview

Run it like this to start the HTTP server:

    ./hiveview --serve --logdir ./workspace/logs

This command runs a web interface on <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. The interface shows
information about all simulation runs for which information was collected.

## Generating Ethereum 1.x test chains (hivechain)

The `hivechain` tool allows you to create RLP-encoded blockchains for inclusion into
simulations. Build it with:

    go build ./cmd/hivechain

To generate a chain of a desired length, run the following command:

    ./hivechain generate -genesis ./genesis.json -length 200

hivechain generates empty blocks by default. The chain will contain non-empty blocks if
the following accounts have balance in genesis state. You can find the corresponding
private keys in the hivechain source code.
