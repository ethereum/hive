# Engine API Test Suite using Consensus Layer Mocking

The Engine API suite runs a set of tests where the execution client is started in Proof of Work mode with a certain TTD (Terminal Total Difficulty). When the TTD is reached, the client switches to produce blocks using the PoS consensus mechanism.

The PoS consensus relies on the Engine API, which receives commands from the consensus clients. This suite mimics a consensus client using a mocking tool to test specific scenarios and combinations of Engine API calls.


## Architecture

The tests by default are started by running a single execution client, and a single instance of the CL Mocker.

Each test case has a default Terminal Total Difficulty of 0.

The secondary client can be spawned and synced if the test case requires so.

Given the following example,

    hive --client=clientA,clientB --sim=ethereum/engine

tests will have the following execution flow: 

for each testCase:
   - clientA:
      - starts (PoW or PoS, depending on TTD)
      - CL Mocker:
         - starts
         - testCaseN:
            - starts
            - (optional) clientA/clientB:
               - starts
               - stops
            - verifications complete
            - stops
         - stops
      - stops
   - clientB:
      - (Same steps repeated)
      - ..

## Engine API Test Cases

General positive and negative test cases based on the description in https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/specification.md

### Engine API Negative Test Cases:

- Inconsistent Head/Safe/Finalized in ForkchoiceState:
Send an inconsistent ForkchoiceState with a known payload that belongs to a side chain as head, safe or finalized:
Having `A: Genesis <- P1 <- P2 <- P3`, `B: Genesis <- P1' <- P2' <- P3'`, 
send `fcU(Head: P3', Safe: P2, Finalized: P1)`, `fcU(Head: P3, Safe: P2', Finalized: P1)`, and `fcU(Head: P3, Safe: P2, Finalized: P1')`

- Unknown HeadBlockHash:  
Perform a forkchoiceUpdated call with an unknown (random) HeadBlockHash, the client should initiate the syncing process.

- Unknown SafeBlockHash:  
Perform a forkchoiceUpdated call with an unknown (random) SafeBlockHash, the client should throw an error since the hash is not an ancestor to the HeadBlockHash.

- Unknown FinalizedBlockHash:  
Perform a forkchoiceUpdated call with an unknown (random) FinalizedBlockHash, the client should throw an error.

- ForkchoiceUpdated Invalid Payload Attributes:
Perform a forkchoiceUpdated call with valid forkchoice but invalid payload attributes.
Expected outcome is that the forkchoiceUpdate proceeds, but the call returns an error.

### Eth RPC Status on ForkchoiceUpdated Events:
- `latest` Block after NewPayload:  
Verify the Block returned by the Eth RPC after a new payload is executed. Eth RPC should still return previous block.

- `latest` Block after New HeadBlockHash:  
Verify the Block returned by the Eth RPC after a new HeadBlockHash is set using forkchoiceUpdated. Eth RPC should return new block.

- `safe` Block after New SafeBlockHash:  
Verify the Block returned by the Eth RPC using the `safe` keyword after a new `SafeBlockHash` is set using `forkchoiceUpdated`. Eth RPC should return block set on the `SafeBlockHash`. When no block has been set as `SafeBlockHash` (`SafeBlockHash==0x00..00`), using `safe` shall return error.

- `finalized` Block after New FinalizedBlockHash:  
Verify the Block returned by the Eth RPC using the `finalized` keyword after a new `FinalizedBlockHash` is set using `forkchoiceUpdated`. Eth RPC should return block set on the `FinalizedBlockHash`. When no block has been set as `FinalizedBlockHash` (`FinalizedBlockHash==0x00..00`), using `finalized` shall return error.

- `safe`, `finalized` on Canonical Chain:
Verify the Block returned by the Eth RPC using the `finalized`/`safe` keyword after following the canonical chain is correctly updated to the canonical values set by `forkchoiceUpdated` calls.

- `latest` Block after Reorg:  
Verify the Block returned by the Eth RPC after a forkchoiceUpdated reorgs HeadBlockHash/SafeBlockHash to a sidechain and back. Eth RPC should return the appropriate block everytime.

### Payload Execution
- Re-Execute Payload:  
Re-execute already executed payloads (10) and verify that no errors occur.

- Multiple New Payloads Extending Canonical Chain:  
Send 80 valid NewPayload directives extending the canonical chain. Only one of the payloads is selected using ForkchoiceUpdated directive.

- Consecutive Payload Execution:  
Launch a first client and produce N payloads.  
Launch a second client and send payloads (NewPayload) consecutive order skipping ForkchoiceUpdated calls.  
The payloads should be validated correctly.

- Valid NewPayload->ForkchoiceUpdated on Syncing Client:
Skip sending NewPayload to the client, but send the ForkchoiceUpdated to this missing payload, which will send the client to Syncing, then send the valid payload. Response should be either `ACCEPTED` or `SYNCING`.

- NewPayload with Missing ForkchoiceUpdated
Chain `Genesis <- ... <- TB <- P1 <- P2 <- ... <- Pn`, `TB` is a valid terminal block. Secondary EL starts with `TB` as the head. `newPayload(P1)`, `newPayload(P2)`, ... `newPayload(Pn)` are sent to the secondary EL, all responses shall be `{status: VALID, latestValidHash: payload.blockHash}`. `forkchoiceUpdated(head: Pn, safe: Pn-1, finalized:Pn-2)` is sent and verified.

- Payload Build after New Invalid Payload:  
Build on top of the latest valid payload after an invalid payload has been received:
`P <- INV_P`, `newPayload(INV_P)`, `fcU(head: P, payloadAttributes: attrs)`, `getPayload(…)`

- Build Payload with Invalid ChainID Transaction:  
Attempt to produce a payload `P` after a transaction `INV_TX` with an invalid Chain ID was sent to the client using `eth_sendRawTransaction`.
Verify that `INV_TX` is not included in the produced payload `P`.

### Invalid Payload Tests
- Bad Hash on NewPayload:  
Send a NewPayload directive to the client including an incorrect BlockHash, should result in an error in all the following cases:
   - NewPayload while not syncing, on canonical chain
   - NewPayload while not syncing, on side chain
   - NewPayload while syncing, on canonical chain
   - NewPayload while syncing, on side chain

- ParentHash equals BlockHash on NewPayload:  
Send a NewPayload directive to the client including ParentHash that is equal to the BlockHash (Incorrect hash).

- Invalid Transition Payload:
Build canonical chain `A: Genesis <- ... <- TB <- P1 <- P2` where TB is a valid terminal block.
Create an invalid transition payload `INV_P1` with parent `TB`.
`newPayload(INV_P1)` must return `{status: INVALID/ACCEPTED, latestValidHash: 0x00..00}`.
`forkchoiceUpdated(head: INV_P1, safe: 0x00..00, finalized: 0x00..00)` must return `{status: INVALID, latestValidHash: 0x00..00}`.

- Invalid Field NewPayload:  
Send an invalid payload in NewPayload by modifying fields of a valid ExecutablePayload while maintaining a valid BlockHash.
After attempting to NewPayload/ForkchoiceUpdated the invalid payload, also attempt to send a valid payload that contains the previously modified invalid payload as parent (should also fail).
Test also has variants with a missing parent payload (client is syncing):
I.e. Skip sending NewPayload to the client, but send the ForkchoiceUpdated to this missing payload, which will send the client to Syncing, then send the invalid payload.
Modify fields including:
   - ParentHash
   - StateRoot
   - ReceiptsRoot
   - BlockNumber
   - GasLimit
   - GasUsed
   - Timestamp
   - PrevRandao
   - Removing a Transaction
   - Non-Empty Uncles
   - Transaction with incorrect fields:
      - Signature
      - Nonce
      - GasPrice
      - GasTip
      - Gas
      - Value
      - ChainID

- Invalid Ancestor Re-Org/Sync Tests
Attempt to re-org to an unknown side chain, or sync to an unknown canonical chain, which at some point contains an invalid payload.
The side chain is constructed in parallel while the CL Mock builds the canonical chain, but changing the extraData to simply produce a different hash.
At a given point, the side chain invalidates one of the payloads by modifying one of the payload fields (See "Invalid Field NewPayload").
Once the side chain reaches a certain deviation height (N) from the commonAncestor, the CL switches to it by either of the following methods:
a) `newPayload` each of the payloads in the side chain, and the invalid payload shall return `INVALID`
b) Force the main client to obtain the chain via syncing by sending the entire invalid chain to a modified geth node, which is capable of accepting and relaying the invalid payloads.
Method (b) results in the client returning `ACCEPTED` or `SYNCING` on the `newPayload(INV_P)`, but eventually the client must return `INVALID` to the head of the side chain because it was built on top of an invalid payload.
```
commonAncestor◄─▲── P1 ◄─ P2 ◄─ P3 ◄─ ... ◄─ Pn
		          │
		          └── P1' ◄─ P2' ◄─ ... ◄─ INV_P ◄─ ... ◄─ Pn'
```

### Re-org using Engine API
- Transaction Reorg:  
Send transactions that modify the state tree after the PoS switch and verify that the modifications are correctly rolled back when a ForkchoiceUpdated event occurs with a block on a different chain than the block where the transaction was included.

- Sidechain Reorg:  
Send a transaction that modifies the state, ForkchoiceUpdate to the payload containing this transaction. Then send an alternative payload, that produces a different state with the same transaction, and use ForkchoiceUpdated to change into this sidechain.

- Re-Org Back into Canonical Chain:  
Test that performing a re-org back into a previous block of the canonical chain does not produce errors and the chain is still capable of progressing.

- Re-Org Back to Canonical Chain From Syncing Chain:
Build an alternative chain of 10 payloads.
Perform `newPayload(P10')` + `fcU(P10')`, which should result in client `SYNCING`. Verify that the client can re-org back to the canonical chain after sending `newPayload(P11)` + `fcU(P11)`.

- Re-org to Previously Validated Sidechain Payload:
Attempt to re-org to one of the sidechain (previously validated) payloads, but not the leaf, and also build a new payload from this sidechain.

- Safe Re-Org to Side Chain:
Perform a re-org of the safe block (and head block) to a valid sidechain.

### Suggested Fee Recipient in Payload creation
- Suggested Fee Recipient Test:  
Set the fee recipient to a custom address and verify that (a) balance is not increased when no fees are collected (b) balance is increased appropriately when fees are collected. Test using Legacy and EIP-1559 transaction types.

### PrevRandao Opcode:
- PrevRandao Opcode Transactions:  
Send transactions that modify the state to the value of the 'DIFFICULTY' opcode and verify that:   
(a) the state is equal to the PrevRandao value provided using forkchoiceUpdated.  

## Engine API Sync Tests:
- Sync Client Post Merge:  
Launch a first client and verify that the transition to PoS occurs.  
Launch a second client and verify that it successfully syncs to the first client's chain.
